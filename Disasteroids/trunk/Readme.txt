================
So what is this?
================

Disasteroids was an end-of-year project by Phillip Cohen
and Andy Kooiman during the 2006-2007 school year, taught
by Mr. Carroll (that year), in B208 at Pearce High school.

This is the SVN version. The first commit here is the
original exam build, untouched, and the rest thereafter
show the project's evolution!

Further revisions will improve the code, naturally, and
this README should be updated - but people forget. :)

Known bugs

- Networking is poorly synched!

Thanks all, folks!
